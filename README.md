This repository contains my implementation for few Machine learning Algorithms.
#### Done
- Exercise 1 contains: Linear Regression - with single variable and multivariable. Using Gradient Descent and Normal Equation. Also applied Feature Scaling.
- Exercise 2 contains: Logistic Regression, Using fminunc(). Also applied Regularization.
- Exercise 3 contains: MNIST digit classification using Logistic Regression(accuracy: 95%) and Neural Network(accuracy: 97.52%).
